        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>The personal information we collect is related to providing the Platform and its features and falls into three general categories:</p>
        <ul class="information_we_collect_list">
          <li>Information you provide to us</li>
          <li>Information collected automatically</li>
          <li>Information we obtain from third parties</li>

        <strong class="information_we_collect_text">Information You Provide</strong>
        <p>We ask for and collect the below personal information when you use the Platform. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our obligations thereunder.</p>
        <p>We process this information in light of our legitimate interest in improving the Platform and giving our users the best experience, and where it is necessary for the adequate performance of any contract between us and you, including but not limited to the Terms of Use. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services and features of the Platform.</p>
        <p>You don’t need to register for a MusicWorld account in order to visit or use our Platform. However, certain Services require that you register for an account and, by doing so, you will need to provide us with certain information:</p>
        <ul >
          <li class="information_we_collect_account"><strong>Account Information</strong> - When you register any kind of SoundCloud account, you will need to provide your email address (except when you sign-up with Facebook, Google or Apple and don’t give your permission to share it with SoundCloud), your age, and choose a password. In addition, if you purchase a Subscription, you will also need to provide your real name, billing address, and payment verification information.</li>
          <li><strong>Profile Information</strong> - you may choose, at your discretion, to provide additional information for your public profile on SoundCloud – for example:

              <li>your gender if you wish to provide it</li>
              <li>any additional information you choose to provide as part of your public profile, such as your real name, and links to your website and other social media profiles (but not your email address), will be published on your profile page. This information will be publicly accessible and may be viewed by anyone accessing the Website, or using our API or other Services.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Communications</strong> - When you communicate with MusicWorld by email or through the Platform, or use the Platform to communicate with other users, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.</li>

          <li><strong>Information You Post</strong> - You may provide personal data when you upload Sounds to the Platform, or when you post comments, or contribute to community discussions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong></p>
        <p>There is certain information that we collect automatically as the result of your use of the Platform, subject to the choices you make in your <a href=""> Settings</a>, or through the use of cookies and other web analytics services as described in our 
            <a href=""> Cookie Policy</a>. This information generally includes:  
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usage Information</strong> - We collect information about your interactions with the Platform, including the pages that you visit and links you click on, streaming, offline listening or downloading tracks, uploading or recording tracks, connecting your Facebook, Google or Apple account, sharing a Sound with another user, following or unfollowing another user, posting a comment, performing a search, the time, frequency and duration of your visits to the Platform, and whether you interact with email messages, for example, if you opened, clicked on, or forwarded the email message.</li>
          <li><strong>Log Data</strong> – We automatically collect log information when you use the Platform, even if you have not registered for an account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Platform (including links to third party sites or services), Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, your browser type and operating system, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies</strong> – We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels, local storage, and mobile device identifiers and may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our <a href=""> Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Location Data</strong> – When you use certain features of the Platform, we may collect data about your general location (e.g. IP address). We use this data to provide you with location-based services (such as advertising and personalized content). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Device Information</strong> – We collect information from and about the devices you use, including how you interact with the Platform and information about the device itself, such as the hardware model, operating system, IP addresses, cookie information, device settings, mobile carrier information, mobile device and advertising identifiers, apps installed, browser type, language, battery level and time zone. Apple’s iOS Advertising Identifier (IDFA) and Google’s Android Advertising ID are examples of device identifiers. This information allows us to recognize and associate your activity, and provide personalized content and advertising, consistently across all of your devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Software Development Kits (“SDK”)</strong> - We may use third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile SDKs to collect information and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Platform. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.</li>
          <li><strong>MusicWorld Widget</strong> - Other websites may integrate MusicWorld widgets; when you visit a website with a SoundCloud widget embedded, we may receive certain information, including information about the website you visited. SoundCloud and the widget may be able to recognize you in order to retrieve your library of content, and in some cases the widget may be used to show personalized content. We know when you interact with a widget, and websites containing the widgets may receive this information as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Information From Third Parties : </h5>
        <li><strong>Single-Sign Ons</strong> – If you sign up for MusicWorld through a third party application like Facebook, Google or Apple, you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your username and encrypted access credentials, and other information available through the third party application account, including the following information:
           <ul>
             <li>Facebook Connect – If you have a Facebook profile, you can create an account or register using the "Facebook Connect" social plugin run by the Facebook social network, which is operated by Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Facebook"), using what is known as Single Sign-On technology. You can recognise the "Facebook Connect" social plugins on our website by the blue button with the Facebook logo and the inscription "Register with Facebook" or "Connect with Facebook" or "Log in with Facebook" or "Sign in with Facebook".</li>
             <p>When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transferred from Facebook directly to your browser, which then embeds it into the website. Through the integrated plugin, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook profile or are not currently logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the US and stored there. These data processing operations are carried out in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1(f) GDPR on the basis of Facebook's legitimate interest in the displaying of personalised advertising on the basis of browsing behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>By using the "Facebook Connect" button on our website, you can also log in or register on our website using your Facebook user data. Depending on your personal data protection settings on Facebook, we will only receive general information that is publicly accessible and stored in your profile when you use Facebook’s "Facebook Connect" button if you give your express consent in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1(a) GDPR prior to the registration process on the basis of a corresponding notification on the exchange of data with Facebook. This information includes your user ID, name, profile picture, age and gender.</p>
            <p>We would like to point out that changes to Facebook's privacy policy and terms of use may also result in the transfer of your profile pictures, your friends' user IDs and friends list if these have been marked as "public" in your Facebook privacy settings. We will store and process the data transmitted by Facebook to create a user account with the necessary data, provided you have approved this on Facebook (title, first name, surname, address details, country, email address, date of birth). Conversely, based on your consent, data (e.g. information on your surfing or purchasing behaviour) may be transferred from us to your Facebook profile.
            </p>
            <p>You may revoke your consent at any time by sending a message to the data controller specified at the beginning of this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <p>Please see Facebook's privacy policies for the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your privacy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.</p>
            <p>If you do not wish Facebook to associate any data collected via our website with your Facebook profile, you should log out of Facebook before you visit our website. You can also completely avoid loading the Facebook plugin with add-ons for your browser.</p>
            <li>Google – You can sign up and log in to MusicWorld using your Google account. When you sign up using Google, Google will ask your permission to share certain information from your Google account with SoundCloud. This includes your Google email address, birthdate (optional), gender (optional), and avatar (optional). This information is collected by Google and is provided to us under the terms of <a href=""> Google’s Privacy Policy</a>
              . You can regulate the information that we receive from Google using your 
              <a href="">Google activity controls</a> . If you signed up using Google by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings at any time, or you can contact us via the
              <a href=""> Help Center</a> .
            </li>
            <li>
              Apple - You may also sign up and log in to MusicWorld using your Apple-ID. When you sign up using your Apple-ID, Apple will ask your permission to share certain information from your Apple account with SoundCloud. This includes your Apple email address, birthdate (optional), gender (optional), and avatar (optional). This information is collected by Apple and is provided to us under the terms of 
              <a href="">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a> . You can regulate the information that we receive from Apple using your Apple-ID settings. If you signed up using Apple by mistake, you can delete your account from the Account page within your Settings at any time, or you can contact us via the
              <a href=""> Help Center</a> .
            </li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers and Business Partners</strong> – We may also receive information about you from our service providers and business partners, including companies that assist with payment processing, analytics, advertising, marketing, data processing and management (e.g. to measure ad quality and responses to ads, and to display ads that are more likely to be relevant to you, including for SoundCloud products) account management, hosting, customer and technical support, content moderation, and other services which we use to personalize your SoundCloud experience. We explain in more detail why and how we use this information below.</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook Connect</strong> - Facebook Connect is additional information provided by you. Apart from connecting your Facebook account with your Soundcloud account for the purposes of registration and signing in, you may provide, based on your free choice (i.e. with your expressed consent) further data from your Facebook profile to enrich your usage and enjoyment of SoundCloud. This especially applies to your likes and/or usage, listening and viewing behaviour as well as your friends within Facebook. In case you decide to share this information with us, we will display relevant artists, playlists and such to you for your liking.

         <h3>Sharing of Your Information</h3>
         <p>This section describes how the information collected or generated through your use of the Platform may be shared by you or by us.</p>
         <ul class="how_we_use_your_information-text">
           <li><strong>Through Your Profile</strong> – Any information in your public profile (other than your email address) will be accessible by other users of the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public Sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages. Creators will be able to see in their statistics that you have listened to the tracks they uploaded. They will also be able to see how many times you have listened to any of their Sounds, and that you are following them. This is to allow creators to track the popularity of their Sounds. Similarly, if you comment on any Sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform.</li>
           <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong> – We will disclose your information if you have agreed that we may do so. We will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information, including the purpose(s) for which we will use the data.</li>
           <li><strong>Service Providers</strong> – We use a variety of service providers, some of who may be located outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), to provide services to us or to our users on our behalf. These service providers have access to your information solely to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us. We need to share your information, including personal information, in order to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you. For instance, we work closely with Service Providers in the area of customer service (i.e. help center, content moderation), with technical service providers (e.g. running computer centres) or music service providers (i.e. rights administration) and payment service providers. These service providers may generally only process your data on our behalf under special conditions.</li>
           <li><strong>Content Partners</strong> – The Platform allows you to listen to a variety of audio content, including licensed streaming content from our commercial content partners. We share information with these content partners that license this content to us to help them understand how the content they provide is performing, including insights about general user listening trends and preferences. We use technical measures to ensure the data is de-identified and/or aggregated so it does not identify you directly. We share this data based on our legitimate interest in helping content partners deliver high performing content and to ensure the fulfillment of our contract with those partners.</li>
           <li><strong>Advertising</strong> – We share the data collected about you, generally in hashed, aggregated, or de-identified forms with advertisers and advertising service providers and business partners in order to serve ads based on your interests and measure the reach and effectiveness of those ads, including whether a user took an action (e.g. purchase a product). We may also share cookie data and device identifiers with service providers for data matching purposes, in order to improve ad targeting. If you are a user located in the EU, you can find a detailed overview of our advertisers <a href="">here</a>.</li>
           <li><strong>Social Media</strong> – For users outside of the EU/EEA, where permissible under applicable law, or with your explicit consent, we may share your email address (in hashed form, so that it does not identify you) with Facebook in order to target you with ads for SoundCloud products on Facebook and on third party websites and applications in the Facebook Audience Network. We also allow Facebook and other social media platforms to collect information through cookies and similar technologies like pixels in order to serve ads for SoundCloud on those third party websites and apps and drive users to our Platform. In order to measure the effectiveness of and optimize these marketing campaigns, these technologies track activity taken across devices after a user sees a SoundCloud ad, in order to determine performance metrics like sign ups, visits to the Platform, and purchases. We undertake these activities based on our legitimate interest in acquiring new customers and offering products we think you may be interested in. Any questions regarding how these social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such third party platform.</li>
           <li><strong>Aggregated Data</strong> – We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we render in such a way that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other pseudonymised information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</li>
           <li><strong>API Integrations</strong> – MusicWorld has an open application-programming interface (API), which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into other apps. Some of these developers may be located outside of the EEA. Any information you choose to make public on the Platform, including your public profile information and any public Sounds, may be accessible to these developers, subject to our
             <a href=""> API Terms of Use</a> . Please bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile. For information on how to limit the information that is available through the API, please see the Your Choices and Controls section below.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Third Party Applications</strong> – If you choose to connect your MusicWorld account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook you may be sharing certain information with these apps or networks. Content that you share with Facebook will appear on your timeline and in your Facebook friends’ newsfeeds. In the case of connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud® account in order to upload and download Sounds, or comment on, favorite, or repost Sounds from within the app. This means sharing your public information, plus access to your private Sounds. SoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust. For information on how to control the information that you share, and how to disconnect your account from these apps, please see the Your Choices and Controls section below. If you do not want this information shared with Facebook or Google, please change your SoundCloud
             <a href="">Settings</a>  on our Platform or in those networks.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Compliance with Laws</strong> – We may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement agencies, and governmental authorities (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against SoundCloud, (iii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iv) to enforce and administer our Terms of Use and other agreements with users, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of SoundCloud, its employees, and members of the public.</li>
           <li><strong>Protecting our Rights</strong> – We may disclose your information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors, officers, or shareholders, and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud community.</li>
           <li><strong>Change of Control</strong> – We may also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control of SoundCloud, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity that buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.</li>
           <li><strong>Analytics, Targeted Communications & Advertising</strong> - <a href="">Here you will find a list of external partners</a>with whom we cooperate and share personal data (often in aggregated or de-identified forms) for analytics, targeted communications and targeted advertising purposes, should you have consented and not turned these toggles off in your

        <h3>Your Choices and Controls</h3>
        <p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.</p>
        <li>
          Managing MusicWorld Settings. If you register an account, you may manage the content and information you share when you use SoundCloud through your account
            <a href="">Settings</a> , including for the features explained below. You are solely responsible for keeping your
            <a href="">Settings</a> up-to-date.
          
        </li>
        <ul class="how_we_use_your_information-text">
          <li><strong>Email</strong> – You can adjust your Settings in the Notification tab to disable email and desktop notifications (other than important service updates and essential notifications about the Platform or your account). All commercial emails and newsletters also allow you to unsubscribe at any time.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics</strong> – To control whether we collect analytics and usage information, including through cookies and similar technologies, you can adjust your Settings in the “Analytics” tab.</li>
          <li> <strong>Marketing </strong> – If you do not want to receive personalized ads, offers or other marketing messages for SoundCloud products or services, you can adjust your Settings in the “Communications” tab.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising</strong> – If you do not want MusicWorld to deliver “interest based” or personalized ads for third party products, you can adjust your Settings in the “Advertising” tab. Please note, however, that even if you opt out of personalized ads, you may still see ads, but they will likely not be as relevant or useful to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Sharing</strong> – It’s not possible to make your account entirely private. However, you do have the option to make all of your tracks, playlists and other uploads private. This means that no one will be able to access and listen to your Sounds without your explicit permission. You can learn more about these settings <a href="">here</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Third Party Apps</strong> – If you have chosen to connect your account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can disable permission for the app by adjusting your Settings in the “Connections” tab.</li>
          <li><strong>Third Party Developers</strong> – MusicWorld has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform. If you would prefer that your Sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the Sounds that you upload. Click on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the “Apps enabled” box at the bottom of the page. Please note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Website.</li>
          <li><strong>Deleting Your Account</strong> – If you have an account and would like to delete it, you may do so by adjusting you Settings in the Account tab. If you delete your account, all data associated with your account (except for backup copies), including the Sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those Sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable. We therefore advise you to copy or backup all content uploaded to your account before deletion. Even if you delete your SoundCloud account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines’ caching processes are outside of SoundCloud’s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform. Please note that deleting any SoundCloud Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud account is connected, will not delete your SoundCloud account. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data about your SoundCloud activity from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete data about your SoundCloud activity from that third party app.</li>
